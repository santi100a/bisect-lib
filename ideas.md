Here are some ideas for additional features that could be added to the bisect function:

1. ~~Custom comparator: Allow the user to provide a custom comparator function that will be used to compare elements in the array. This would enable bisecting on more complex data types that cannot be compared using the built-in > and < operators.~~

2. ~~Return all indices: Currently, the bisect function returns only the index of the first occurrence of the target in the array. It could be useful to also return the indices of all occurrences of the target in the array.~~

3. ~~Reverse search: Currently, the bisect function assumes that the array is sorted in ascending order. It could be useful to have an option to search a sorted array in descending order as well.~~

4. ~~Range search: Allow the user to specify a range of indices to search within the array, instead of searching the entire array. This could improve the performance of the function on very large arrays.~~

5. ~~Error tolerance: For arrays that contain floating-point numbers, it may be useful to allow for some degree of error tolerance in the comparison of elements. This would help avoid situations where the target is not found due to rounding errors.~~
